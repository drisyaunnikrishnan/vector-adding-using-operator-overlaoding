# vector-adding-using-operator-overlaoding
. Create a class Vector contains data members a, b, c as coefficients of i,j,k and member functions to read and display vector objects. Write a C++ program to find the difference between two vector objects using the concept operator overloading with friend function. Eg. (a1i + b1j + c1k) - (a2i + b2j + c2k) = (a1 – a2)i + (b1-b2)j + (c1 – c2) k
